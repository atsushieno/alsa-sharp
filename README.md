# alsa-sharp

alsa-sharp is a Mono and .NET Core binding to [ALSA API](http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/index.html), mostly targeting sequencer for MIDI.

The API is twofolds:

- The non-public AlsaSharp.Natives class is mostly (but not completely) generated by [nclang](https://github.com/atsushieno/nclang) PInvokeGenerator and contains P/Invokes around `libasound`.

- Other public types are object-oriented API that wraps AlsaSharp.Natives and designed for use in applications.

AlsaSharp does not contain (very) high-level API. [managed-midi](https://github.com/atsushieno/managed-midi) is more generalized, higher-level API across platforms.
